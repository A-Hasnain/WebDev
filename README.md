Hi, I'm Khaja Hasnain Hazeebe Affan, but you can call me Hasnain. I’m from Hyderabad, India, and I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Osmania University. Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems at Northeastern University. Although I have a degree in Computer Science, I’m not as strong in programming as I’d like to be, but I’m actively working to improve that. In my free time, I enjoy gardening, playing video games, working out, and going on long walks and road trips.
